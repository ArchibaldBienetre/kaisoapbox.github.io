  # greetings, friend! 🥰
  kai here, thanks for visiting my website! here are a couple things you might be interested in:
  * [Android apps for local privacy-first speech transcription](/projects/local_whisper)
  * [a short silly story game](/projects/gone_to_the_store)
  * [I also write!](/blog)

  I am always working on several new projects, here are the current highlights:
	* another story game titled "You're Not a Monk"
  * a guide on how to cook without time, money, or skill, tentatively titled The Minimum Viable Kitchen [or perhaps The Bachelor(ette)'s Cooking Guide]

  if you wanna be kept up to date with all the things I do, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaisoapbox)! I should really get a mailing list...
