# greetings, friend! ü•∞
kai here, thanks for visiting my website! here are a couple things you might be interested in:

I am always working on several new projects, here are the current highlights:

- another story game titled "You're Not a Monk"
- a guide on how to cook without time, money, or skill, tentatively titled The Minimum Viable Kitchen [or perhaps The Bachelor(ette)'s Cooking Guide]
